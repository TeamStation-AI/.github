# Stop Gambling on Talent. Start Engineering Your Team.

Traditional nearshore is a keyword-matching lottery. You get a list of candidates, not a cohesive, high-performance team. This is the old way.

We've built the new way: **An Intelligent Services Infrastructure** to construct elite LATAM engineering teams with unparalleled accuracy.

### The Core: Our Talent Alignment Engine

This is not a database of résumés. It's a data-driven synthesis engine powered by 44 proprietary psychometric, behavioral, and technical algorithms. Our NLP models analyze a candidate's entire technical history to create a multi-dimensional proficiency graph, allowing us to predict performance and cultural fit with a 95%+ accuracy rate.

*   **The Competition:** Matches keywords.
*   **TeamStation:** Predicts technical and cultural alignment using a proprietary data model.
